## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting
- **Admin Authentication**: 10 requests/minute
- **Client Authentication**: 15 requests/minute
- **API Operations**: 20-100 requests/minute (endpoint-dependent)
- **Exchange Rates**: 60 requests/minute
- **Payment Operations**: 5-30 requests/minute (security-dependent)

### Abuse Protection
- **Failed Login Threshold**: 10-30 attempts before blocking
- **Block Duration**: 1 hour (configurable)
- **Whitelist Support**: Localhost and trusted IPs exempt
- **Escalating Penalties**: Repeat offenders get longer blocks

### Fraud Detection
- **Risk Thresholds**: Low (0.3), Medium (0.6), High (0.8), Critical (0.9)
- **Actions**: Log â†’ Alert â†’ Block â†’ Ban
- **Monitoring**: Failed logins, suspicious withdrawals, unusual patterns
- **Real-time Analysis**: Risk scoring for all financial operations

### Webhook Security
- **Signature Verification**: HMAC SHA-256 with secret
- **Timestamp Tolerance**: 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Replay Protection**: Prevents duplicate webhook processing
- **Rate Limiting**: 60-100 requests/minute for webhook endpoints

## ðŸš€ Production Readiness

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Webhook Security
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-key

# Security Settings
SECURITY_ENABLED=true
FRAUD_DETECTION_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true

# Alert Configuration
SECURITY_ALERT_EMAIL=security@yourcompany.com
SECURITY_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-monitoring-system.com/webhooks
```

### Monitoring Setup
- Security event dashboard
- Failed login rate monitoring
- API abuse detection alerts
- Fraud detection notifications
- Webhook failure tracking

### Testing

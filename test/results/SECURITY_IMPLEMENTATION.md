# CPGateway Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for the CPGateway system, including rate limiting, fraud detection, audit logging, webhook security, and abuse protection.

## Security Components

### 1. Rate Limiting (`app/utils/security.py`)

The rate limiting system protects against API abuse and DoS attacks:

- **Memory-based fallback**: Works without Redis for development
- **Redis-based production**: Distributed rate limiting for production environments
- **Configurable limits**: Different limits per endpoint type
- **Automatic cleanup**: Expired entries are automatically removed

#### Usage:
```python
@rate_limit('endpoint_name', requests_per_minute=30)
def my_endpoint():
    pass
```

### 2. Abuse Protection (`app/utils/security.py`)

Advanced protection against repeated abuse attempts:

- **IP-based blocking**: Blocks IPs that exceed thresholds
- **Automatic unblocking**: Blocked IPs are automatically released after timeout
- **Whitelist support**: Certain IPs (like localhost) are never blocked
- **Escalating penalties**: Repeat offenders get longer blocks

#### Usage:
```python
@abuse_protection('endpoint_name', threshold=100)
def my_endpoint():
    pass
```

### 3. Fraud Detection (`app/utils/fraud_detection.py`)

Real-time fraud detection and risk scoring:

- **Withdrawal analysis**: Detects suspicious withdrawal patterns
- **Failed login monitoring**: Tracks and flags repeated failed logins
- **Payment pattern analysis**: Identifies unusual payment creation patterns
- **Risk scoring**: Returns risk scores from 0.0 (safe) to 1.0 (high risk)
- **Alerting system**: Automatically alerts on high-risk activities

#### Key Features:
- Detects withdrawals without recent deposits
- Flags unusual amounts or frequencies
- Monitors failed login attempts from same IP
- Analyzes payment creation patterns

### 4. Webhook Security (`app/utils/webhook_security.py`)

Secure webhook processing with multiple validation layers:

- **HMAC signature verification**: Ensures webhooks are from trusted sources
- **Timestamp validation**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Replay attack protection**: Tracks processed webhooks to prevent duplicates
- **Rate limiting integration**: Built-in rate limiting for webhook endpoints

#### Features:
- SHA-256 HMAC signature verification
- Configurable timestamp tolerance (default: 5 minutes)
- Automatic replay attack detection
- Detailed logging of webhook events

### 5. Audit Logging (`app/utils/audit.py`)

Comprehensive audit trail for security and compliance:

- **Security events**: Failed logins, blocked IPs, fraud detection
- **Admin actions**: All administrative operations
- **API usage**: Complete API request logging
- **Client changes**: Setting modifications, key generations
- **Transaction decisions**: Payment approvals, withdrawals

#### Event Types:
- `log_security_event()`: Security-related events
- `log_admin_action()`: Administrative actions
- `log_api_usage()`: API request logging
- `log_client_setting_change()`: Client configuration changes
- `log_transaction_decision()`: Financial transaction decisions

## Integration Points

### Admin Routes (`app/admin/routes.py`)

Secured admin endpoints include:
- Login/logout with rate limiting and failed attempt tracking
- Payment status changes with audit logging
- Refund processing with fraud detection hooks
- Settings management with security event logging
- IP blocking for repeated failed admin logins

### Admin Client Management (`app/admin/client_routes.py`)

Secured client management operations:
- Client creation and editing with rate limiting
- Comprehensive audit logging for all client changes
- Security event logging for sensitive operations

### Admin Withdrawal Management (`app/admin/withdrawal_routes.py`)

Secured withdrawal operations:
- Rate limiting on approval/rejection endpoints
- Fraud detection integration
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security event logging for high-risk transactions

### Platform API (`app/api/platform_routes.py`)

Secured platform operations:
- Platform registration with rate limiting
- Payment initiation with fraud detection
- Webhook processing with signature verification
- Settings management with audit logging

### Client Settings API (`app/api/client_settings.py`)

Secured client self-service operations:
- API key generation with rate limiting and security logging
- Webhook settings with comprehensive audit trails
- Branding management with change tracking

### Exchange API (`app/api/exchange_routes.py`)

Secured exchange operations:
- Rate limiting on exchange rate requests
- API usage logging for monitoring
- Abuse protection against scraping

### Package Payment Routes (`app/package_payment_routes.py`)

Secured payment processing:
- Package activation with fraud detection
- Payment creation with risk analysis
- Payment status checking with rate limiting
- Demo simulation endpoints with strict controls

### Webhook Endpoints (`app/webhooks.py`)

Secured webhook processing:
- Signature verification for all incoming webhooks
- Rate limiting and abuse protection
- Comprehensive security event logging
- Error handling with security implications

## Configuration

### Security Configuration (`app/config/security_config.py`)

Centralized configuration for all security components:

- **Rate Limits**: Configurable per-endpoint rate limits
- **Abuse Thresholds**: Configurable blocking thresholds
- **Fraud Detection**: Risk thresholds and actions
- **Webhook Security**: Signature and replay protection settings
- **Audit Configuration**: Logging levels and retention
- **IP Blocking**: Failed login thresholds and durations

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for production:

```bash
# Redis Configuration (for production rate limiting)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Webhook Security
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-key

# Security Settings
SECURITY_ENABLED=true
FRAUD_DETECTION_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true

# Alert Configuration
SECURITY_ALERT_EMAIL=security@yourcompany.com
SECURITY_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-monitoring-system.com/webhooks
```

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Authentication Metrics**:
   - Failed login attempts per hour
   - Blocked IP addresses
   - Concurrent sessions per user

2. **API Metrics**:
   - Rate limit hits per endpoint
   - API error rates
   - Unusual request patterns

3. **Transaction Metrics**:
   - High-risk transaction attempts
   - Fraud detection alerts
   - Withdrawal patterns

4. **System Metrics**:
   - Webhook verification failures
   - Security event frequency
   - Abuse protection activations

### Alert Thresholds

Default alert thresholds (configurable):
- Failed logins: 50 per hour
- High-risk transactions: 10 per hour
- API errors: 100 per hour
- Webhook failures: 20 per hour

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Regular Security Reviews

- Review security logs weekly
- Analyze fraud detection patterns monthly
- Update rate limits based on usage patterns
- Monitor for new attack vectors

### 2. Incident Response

- Immediate IP blocking for critical threats
- Alert escalation for high-risk events
- Automated security event correlation
- Manual review of flagged transactions

### 3. Configuration Management

- Use environment variables for sensitive settings
- Regular rotation of webhook secrets
- Monitoring of configuration changes
- Backup of security configurations

### 4. Testing and Validation

- Regular security testing of all endpoints
- Validation of rate limiting effectiveness
- Testing of fraud detection accuracy
- Webhook security validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limiting Too Strict**:
   - Review and adjust rate limits in `security_config.py`
   - Monitor legitimate user impact
   - Consider different limits for different user types

2. **False Positive Fraud Detection**:
   - Review risk scoring algorithms
   - Adjust thresholds based on business requirements
   - Implement whitelist for trusted users

3. **Webhook Verification Failures**:
   - Verify webhook secret configuration
   - Check timestamp synchronization
   - Review signature generation process

4. **Performance Impact**:
   - Monitor Redis performance for rate limiting
   - Optimize security check frequency
   - Consider caching for fraud detection

### Debugging

Enable detailed security logging:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('app.utils.security').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('app.utils.fraud_detection').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

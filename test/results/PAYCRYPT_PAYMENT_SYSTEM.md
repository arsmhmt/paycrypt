# Paycrypt Payment System Implementation

## Overview
Paycrypt uses its own integrated cryptocurrency payment system - **NO external payment processors like Stripe or PayPal are used**. All payments are processed directly through Paycrypt's proprietary crypto payment infrastructure.

## Key Features of Paycrypt's Payment System

### 1. **Own Payment Infrastructure**
- **No Stripe Integration**: All Stripe references have been removed from the codebase
- **No PayPal Integration**: PayPal dependencies have been removed
- **Pure Crypto Processing**: Uses Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 150+ cryptocurrencies
- **Self-Contained**: All payment logic is internal to Paycrypt

### 2. **Package Activation Payment Flow**
- **$1000 USD Setup Fee**: One-time activation fee for new clients
- **Crypto Payment Required**: Setup fee must be paid in Bitcoin (or other supported crypto)
- **Real-time Exchange Rates**: BTC/USD rates calculated dynamically
- **24-hour Payment Window**: Payments must be completed within 24 hours
- **Automatic Activation**: Package activates automatically after payment confirmation

### 3. **Payment Processing Components**

#### A. Payment Models (`app/models/package_payment.py`)
```python
class PackageActivationPayment:
    - setup_fee_amount: USD amount ($1000)
    - crypto_amount: Calculated BTC equivalent
    - crypto_address: Generated payment address
    - exchange_rate: BTC/USD rate at time of creation
    - status: PENDING ‚Üí COMPLETED
    - expires_at: 24-hour expiry
```

#### B. Payment Routes (`app/package_payment_routes.py`)
- `/package-payment/activate/<package_id>`: Initiate payment
- `/package-payment/payment/<payment_id>`: Show payment details
- `/package-payment/check-payment/<payment_id>`: Check payment status
- `/package-payment/simulate-payment/<payment_id>`: Demo payment simulation

#### C. Payment Templates
- `package_payment/payment_details.html`: Payment instruction page
- Shows BTC address, QR code, amount, and countdown timer
- Real-time payment status checking

### 4. **Paycrypt-Specific Features**

#### A. Configuration (`app/config.py`)
```python
# Payment Provider Settings - Paycrypt's Own System
PAYCRYPT_PAYMENT_SYSTEM = True
# No external payment processors required
```

#### B. Settings Model (`app/models/setting.py`)
```python
# Integration Settings - Paycrypt's Own Payment System
PAYCRYPT_WALLET_ADDRESS = 'paycrypt_wallet_address'
PAYCRYPT_API_KEY = 'paycrypt_api_key'
```

#### C. Payment Methods (`app/forms/payment_forms.py`)
```python
payment_method = SelectField('Payment Method', choices=[
    ('bitcoin', 'Bitcoin'),
    ('ethereum', 'Ethereum'),
    ('litecoin', 'Litecoin'),
    ('crypto', 'Cryptocurrency'),
    ('other', 'Other')
])
```

### 5. **Exchange Rate System**
- **Real-time Rates**: Uses `app/utils/exchange.py` for current BTC/USD rates
- **Fallback Rates**: Default rates if external APIs are unavailable
- **Multiple Currencies**: Supports USD, EUR, GBP, TRY
- **Rate Locking**: Exchange rate locked for 24-hour payment window

### 6. **Demo/Testing Features**

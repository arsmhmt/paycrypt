Remove or rename the following legacy files to prevent accidental import and registration of old admin blueprints:

- app/admin_routes.py
- app/admin_routes.py.bak
- app/admin_routes_clean.py

Only use the secure admin blueprint in app/admin/routes.py.

This will ensure that no old /admin routes are ever registered.
